## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about a CSS property: mix-blend-mode which sets how an element's content should blend with the content of its parent and the element's background.  

### Continued development

I also realised that it is not good to start coding the moment I begin the project. I should first understand the problem, come up with a plan/logic, come up with a structure for HTML and then start coding once everything looks good. Breaking the problem into smaller chunks make the problem a bit simpler than it looks.
### Useful resources

- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31458477/find-element-that-is-causing-the-showing-of-horizontal-scrollbar-in-google-chrom) - I had problems with overflowing content. This answer helped a lot. It says to add a outline to all the elements and see which element is causing the overflow. As outlines are drawn over the element unlike borders, they do not alter the positioning
